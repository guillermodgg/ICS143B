My program is written in C++, and every file is contained in the src folder of this project. I used clang++ this time to compile my project, and an executable "a.out" is included in my submission. To create another executable, compile on main.cpp with any C++ compiler preferred.

To run the program, provide the executable with two command line arguments: the initialization file followed by the input file. I.E. "./a.out init-dp.txt input-dp.txt". The output file it is set to produce is called "output-dp.txt"

I implemented my program with demand paging, but I have also submitted the output version without demand paging for safety. I also utilized an auxilery module called "linked_list.cpp" which I used to create the linked list of free frames.
